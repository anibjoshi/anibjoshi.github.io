Hi! I'm Ani and I work as a Product Manager in the Data & AI division at IBM. I am an engineer turned Product Manager who loves tinkering with new technology and loves to learn new things.
I have had a diverse number of roles in the technology industry over the past 10 years - 
- Corporate Strategy at IBM where I worked on AI strategy, strategic partnerships with AWS, and M&A due diligence for acquisitions in the data management industry.
- Venture architect at Create Ventures where I evaluated startup ideas for viability and worked with enterpreneurs-in-residence on their MVPs.
- Software Engineer at Oracle where I built B2B SaaS products for the enterprise market

On the side, I love tinkering with technologies for fun and learning. I'm currently trying to train an AI to drive a car in Forza Horizon 5. Some of my other (major) projects include a Slack chatbot that retrieves documents based on keywords and an LLM based MS Excel formula generation tool.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of Pune and an MBA from Columbia University. I am currently pursuing a part-time graduate program in AI at Stanford University.
